  <p>Birds are chirping, leaves are falling, and the air is crisper with the beginning of autumn.
    There is something about late September and early October that fills me with so much hope.
    I just love the crisp weather, the changing colors, and the anticipation of the holidays.
    I love the crisp, cold mornings when you have to put on a sweater or jacket and the softness of the sun when it wakes me up.
    I love the scent of wood smoke, the smell of Halloween, and the thrill of the leaves falling off the trees.
    I love the mild temperature and the wonderful cool days.
    I love the bright colors of fall.
    I love the smells of pumpkin and apple pie baking.</p>
